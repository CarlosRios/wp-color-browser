WP Color Browser allows you to easily add custom color settings to the mobile browser while your website or app is being viewed.

== Description ==
WP Color Browser uses the theme-color meta tag which is used in browsers such as Google Chrome to customize the mobile browser. Currently WP Color Browser is only working on the mobile version of Google Chrome because that is the only browser to implement the theme-color meta tag. More settings will be added to the plugin as more browers adopt use of theme-color and other meta tags.
